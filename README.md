a simple interpreter

### design

source code -> tokens -> expression

tokens & expression -> statement

for every statement there is an "execute" method

### grammar

there are examples in the dir of ./example

the grammar is kind of a mixtrue of C and javaScript

### usage

use "make" to build the program

executable file is named as "test"

./test filepath

for example :

./test ./example/helloWorld.txt
